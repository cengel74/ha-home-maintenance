## Usage

### Creating a Task

1. Open the **Home Maintenance Pro** panel from the sidebar.
2. Click **Add Task**.
3. Fill in the task name, interval (value and type: days/weeks/months), and an optional description.
4. Optionally set the **Last Performed** date if the task has been done before.
5. Click **Save**.

### Using the Template Library

1. Click **Browse Templates** from the task list.
2. Browse or search the 90+ pre-built tasks.
3. Click a template to pre-fill the form, then adjust as needed and click **Save**.

### Importing Tasks from CSV

1. Click **Browse Templates** from the task list.
2. Click the **Import CSV** button.
3. Select a `.csv` file. The required column is `title`; optional columns are `description`, `interval_value`, `interval_type`, `last_performed`, and `icon`.
4. Review the preview table and click **Import** to create all tasks.

Example CSV:

```csv
title,description,interval_value,interval_type,last_performed,icon
Replace HVAC Filter,Change the air filter,90,days,2026-01-15,mdi:air-filter
Clean Gutters,Remove debris from gutters,180,days,,mdi:home-roof
```

### Exporting Tasks to CSV

1. From the task list, click **Export CSV**.
2. A `home_maintenance_tasks.csv` file will be downloaded containing all tasks with their title, description, interval, last performed date, icon, labels, and notification setting.

### Searching and Filtering

- Use the **search box** at the top of the task list to filter by title or description.
- Click **label chips** below the search box to filter by one or more Home Assistant labels. Tasks matching any selected label are shown (OR logic). Click a selected chip again to deselect it, or use the **Clear** button to reset all label filters.

### Editing a Task

1. Click the pencil icon on any row in the task table.
2. Modify any fields and click **Save**.

### Completing a Task

- Click the checkmark icon on a task row to mark it complete. The last performed date is set to today and the next due date advances by the task's interval.
- Alternatively, scan the NFC tag associated with the task (see NFC setup below).

### Overdue Notifications

Each task has a **Notify when overdue** toggle on the create/edit form. When enabled, a persistent notification is created in Home Assistant as soon as the task transitions to overdue status. The notification is automatically deduplicated per task so you only see one at a time.

### NFC Tags

1. Edit a task and note its **Task ID** displayed in the form.
2. Write the following URL to an NFC tag using any NFC writing app:

   ```
   https://your-ha-instance.local/api/ha_home_maintenance/complete/<task_id>
   ```

3. Scanning the tag will mark the task complete immediately.

## Automations

Each task exposes a `binary_sensor` entity with a name derived from the task. The sensor is `on` when the task is overdue and `off` when it is current.

A global sensor `binary_sensor.home_maintenance_any_overdue` is `on` whenever at least one task is overdue.

### Example Automation

```yaml
automation:
  alias: "Notify when maintenance is overdue"
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.home_maintenance_any_overdue
      to: "on"
  action:
    - service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
      data:
        title: "Home Maintenance Pro Overdue"
        message: "One or more home maintenance tasks need attention."
```
